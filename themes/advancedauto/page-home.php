      <h3 class="section-headline">We do <strong>everything you need</strong> to keep your vehicle in top shape, from changing filters and fluids to changing motors.</h3>
      <ul>
         <li><h5>Brakes</h5> Keeping your brakes in shape is important to the safety of your vehicle, which is why we

always offer a free brake check. We will report our findings back to you, and if there are any

problems, we will provide you with an estimate.</li>
         <li><h5>Wheel alignment</h5> Misalignment causes premature tire wear and adversely affects the handling of

your vehicle. If problems are found when we check your wheel alignment, we will take the time to

explain what is wrong and how to correct it.</li>
         <li><h5>Shock absorbers</h5> Designed to absorb and dampen shocks from travelling over rough ground,

shock absorbers improve ride quality and vehicle handling. Worn out shock absorbers or struts can

cause severe handling issues and premature tire wear.</li>
         <li><h5>Tune-­ups</h5> To maintain your vehicle's performance and efficiency, each vehicle has a regular

scheduled service maintenance list. Sometimes it is as simple as an oil change, other times it's

more complex, like a timing belt.</li>
         <li><h5>Windshields</h5> We do replacement windshields on all makes and models, both insurance and non-insurance work, as well as side glass replacement and stone bruise repair while you wait.</li>
         <li><h5>Exhaust</h5> We can do small jobs like changing mufflers or large jobs like a custom fit exhaust on

your hot rod. We have a pipe bender on site and can make your custom exhaust just the way you

like it.</li>
         <li><h5>Mechanical services</h5> From time to time, vehicles have mechanical issues. We can handle small

jobs like changing alternators to larger jobs like engine changing or rebuilding. The key to good

mechanical services is good technicians and proper equipment.</li>
         <li><h5>Interior repair</h5> With a dedicated upholsterer, most interior repairs are a breeze. We can repair a

torn panel or restitch torn seams in a jiffy.</li>
         <li><h5>Collision repair</h5> Our collision repair team consists of five dedicated body technicians and three

paint technicians. We also have two frame straightening mechanics, two dust­free downdraft paint

booths, and a factory­trained Mercedes­qualified painter. Ask about our written lifetime warranty.</li>
